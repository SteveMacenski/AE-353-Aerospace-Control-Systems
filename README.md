# AE-353-Aerospace-Control-Systems
Aerospace Control Systems

The code in this repo represents my working code in AE 353 taught by Professor Bretl in Spring of 2015. 

All code framework was written by Professor Bretl while only control loops and params definitions where me where a simulation exists. Programs without simulations are from me. I have permission from Professor Bretl to post this content.
